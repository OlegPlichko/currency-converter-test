# Todo List

This document outlines shortcuts taken during development and areas for immediate improvement:

## Shortcuts Taken

1. **Error Handling**: Limited error handling for edge cases (e.g., very large numbers, potential API failures if real API was used)
2. **Input Validation**: Basic validation implemented, but more comprehensive validation could be added
3. **Responsive Design**: Basic responsiveness implemented, but could be improved for various screen sizes
4. **Accessibility**: Basic a11y features implemented, but a full audit is needed
5. **Testing**: No automated tests were implemented due to time constraints
6. **State Management**: Using React's built-in state management rather than a more scalable solution like Redux or Context API
7. **Performance Optimization**: No specific performance optimizations like memoization

## Immediate Improvements

1. Add more unit tests for all components and functions
2. Implement proper error boundaries and better error handling
3. Enhance accessibility features (ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation)
4. Add proper form validation with error messaging
5. Optimize re-renders using React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback
6. Improve mobile responsiveness with more breakpoints
7. Add loading states and better visual feedback for users
8. Implement proper internationalization for numbers and currencies
